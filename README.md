# Clone-of-YouTube

An exact clone of YouTube.

An exact copy of YouTube was created using RapidAPI in combination with React + Vite.

Axios, React, React-Router-DOM, React-Icons, Tailwind and Vite applications were used in the project, which was carefully created with every detail taken into consideration and every direction was actively working.

You can review the project and provide feedback on necessary situations.

Please take a look at the two images below of the project.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
